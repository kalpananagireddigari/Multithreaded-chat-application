**📌 Project Description**
**Multithreaded Chat Application :**

This project is a Java-based Multithreaded Chat Application that enables multiple clients to communicate simultaneously with a server using socket programming. 

The system is designed using multithreading concepts, where each client connection is handled by a separate thread, allowing real-time concurrent communication.

The application demonstrates the practical implementation of:

Java Socket Programming.

Multithreading (Thread / Runnable).

Client-Server Architecture.

Concurrent Communication Handling


**🎯 Objective**

To design and implement a client-server chat system that supports multiple users concurrently using Java multithreading.


This project highlights how parallel processing improves responsiveness and supports multiple users in a network-based chat system.


**⚙️ How It Works**

The server starts and listens on a specific port.

Multiple clients connect to the server.

For each client connection, a new thread is created.

Messages sent by one client are received and processed independently.

The server manages concurrent communication without blocking other users.


**🚀 Feature**

Supports multiple clients simultaneously

Thread-based connection handling

Real-time message exchange

Simple and lightweight architecture

Console-based interaction

**🛠 Technologies Used**

Java.

Socket Programming.

Multithreading.

TCP/IP Networking.


**✅ Conclusion **

The project successfully implements a multithreaded client-server chat system using Java.

Multiple clients can communicate simultaneously without blocking each other.

Each client connection is handled using separate threads for concurrent execution.

The application demonstrates practical use of socket programming and multithreading concepts.

It improves understanding of real-time communication and distributed systems.

The system forms a foundation for building scalable network-based applications.
